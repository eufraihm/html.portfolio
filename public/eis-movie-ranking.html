<h1>The Nice Movies According to Euf</h1>
<h2>My top 4 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is also one of my favourite anime film. I love the theme.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>Cool Fantasy Film. <br/>
I'm with good friends of mine when I watch it.
</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>Classic Movie. Makes your mind and heart react</p>
<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>
This is very futuristic with a pessimistic approach.<br />
The means to solve the problem and the power of love conquers all.
